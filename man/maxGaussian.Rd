\title{Maximize Gaussian}
\usage{
maxGaussian(mu, sigma2, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The mean component}

\item{sigma2}{The variance component}

\item{x}{Is the state we know nothing about.}
}
\value{
The value that maximize Gaussian
}
\description{
This function Maximizes a Gaussian Distribution
}
\details{
We can set x = mu, so that we get the peak of the Gaussian  as the peak always occurs at the mean (looking at a Gaussian distribution). This is why we set x= when we want to maximize.
