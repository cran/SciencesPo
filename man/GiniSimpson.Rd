\description{
Computes the Gini/Simpson coefficient. \code{NA}s from the data are omitted.
}
\details{
The Gini-Simpson quadratic index is a classic measure of
diversity, widely used by social scientists and ecologists.
The Gini-Simpson is also known as Gibbs-Martin index in sociology,
 psychology and management studies, which in turn is also known as
 the Blau index. The Gini-Simpson index is computed as
 \eqn{1 - \lambda = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^R p_i^2 = 1 - 1/{}^2D}.

\examples{
# generate a vector (of incomes)
x <- as.table(c(69,50,40,22))
# let's say AB coalesced
rownames(x) <- c("AB","C","D","E")
print(x)

GiniSimpson(x)
