\title{The D'Hondt Method of Allocating Seats Proportionally}
\usage{
dHondt(parties = NULL, votes = NULL, seats = NULL, ...)

dHondt(parties = NULL, votes = NULL, seats = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{parties}{a vector containig parties labels or candidates accordingly to the \code{votes} vector order.}

\item{votes}{a vector containing the total number of formal votes received by the parties/candidates.}

\item{seats}{an integer for the number of seats to be filled (the district magnitude).}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguements (currently ignored)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of length \code{parties} containing apportioned integers (seats) summing to \code{seats}.
}
\description{
The function calculates seats allotment in legislative house,
given the total number of seats and the votes for each party based on the
Victor D'Hondt's method (1878). The D'Hondt's method is mathematically
equivalent to the method proposed by Thomas Jefferson few years before (1792).

\examples{
votes <- sample(1:10000, 5)
parties <- sample(LETTERS, 5)

dHondt(parties, votes, seats = 4)


# Example: 2014 Brazilian election for the lower house in
# the state of Ceara. Coalitions were leading by the
# following parties:

results <- c(DEM=490205, PMDB=1151547, PRB=2449440,
PSB=48274, PSTU=54403, PTC=173151)

dHondt(parties=names(results), votes=results, seats=19)
