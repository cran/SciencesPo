# Introduction

The very objective of the *SciencesPo* package is to provide methods for computing some of the popular measures in political science literature. Apart from their usefulness for categorization, empirical indices intended to capture political abstractions and provide data for causal reasoning. Examples at the core of the discipline include measures of political concentration and fragmentation, political competition, and apportionment methods to transform election results into seats.

This vignette is intended to illustrate some of the applications available in the R library *SciencesPo*, which can be used to compute those measures of political behavior. The rest of this vignette is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the technical details and examples of seat apportionment methods. Section 3 illustrates the use of political diversity functions to obtain empirical indices of a political system environment, such as the effective number of parties, the nationalization of political parties, and political competition. Section 4 provides examples of computing proportionality statistics, and section 5 does so for inequality indices. 


# Seat Apportionment Methods 

Most democratic countries use apportionment methods to transform election results into whole numbers, which indicate the number of seats that each party obtained in a legislative body. Which apportionment method does this best is not a trivial topic in political science and that several methods have been proposed. The following sections briefly present some of these apportionment methods.

## Highest Averages Methods of Allocating Seats Proportionally

Highest averages methods allocate seats proportionally to the number of votes by assigning seats in a way that assures the highest quotient by seat for each party. Other methods divide the votes by a mathematically derived quota, such as Droop and Hare quotas. In what follows are illustrative examples taken from Lijphart (1994) of the operation of some highest averages formulas in a six member district with four parties.


```{r table_A.1, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Table A.l
lijphart <- c("A"=41000, "B"=29000,"C"=17000, "D"=13000)
```

The basic imputs for this class of functions are: 1) a list of parties, 2) a list of positive votes, and 3) a constant value for the number of seats to be returned. A numeric value (0~1) for the threshold is optional.

By default, the function prints the apportionment method being used, a snippet of the divisors, the effective number of parties index, and the least squares index--or Gallager index.

### d'Hondt
Under the D'Hondt formula, seats are allocated using divisors of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Thus, suggesting that the divisors are simply one more than the number of seats that party already has. 


```{r highestAverages1, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
library("SciencesPo")

# The d'Hondt will give the same results as Jefferson's method
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart,
                seats = 6, 
                method = "dh") 
```

The d'Hondt is only one way of allocating seats in party list systems. Other methods include the Saint-Laguë, the modified Saint-Laguë, the Danish version, Imperiali (do not to confuse with the Imperiali quota, which is a Largest remainder method), Hungtinton-Hill, Webster, etc. 


### Saint-Laguë

Named after its founder, the pure Sainte-Laguë formula, also known as Schepers method, uses the odd-integer divisor series (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) to elect candidates from political parties in approximate proportion as the proportion of votes won by the party. The outcome would be the same as the outcome produced by the Webster's divisors method.

```{r highestAverages2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
# The Sainte-Laguë will give the same results as the Webster's method (wb)
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart,
                seats = 6,
                method = "sl") 
```

### Modified Saint-Laguë

The modified Sainte-Laguë use divisors of 1.4, 3, 5, 7, etc. How does the d'Hondt divisor compare to the Modified Sainte-Laguë one? Which divisor method tend to favor larger parties and which one smaller parties?

```{r highestAverages3, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6,
                method = "msl") 
```


### Danish

The Danish divisors (1, 4, 7, 10, ...) increase so fast that large parties are quickly cut down, acting much to the benefit of smaller parties.

```{r highestAverages4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart), 
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6, 
                method = "danish") 
```

### Hungarian

The Hungarian version of Sainte-Laguë uses divisors of (1.5, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...) increase so fast that large parties are quickly cut down, acting much to the benefit of smaller parties.

```{r highestAverages5, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6, 
                method = "hsl") 
```


### Webster

This approach does not use a standard divisor either. It uses instead a different divisor and modified quota such that rounding with cut-off point at *algebraic* mean of lower and upper quotas: wb = $\frac{L + (L + 1)}{2}$.

```{r highestAverages6, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6, 
                method = "wb") 
```


### Imperiali

The Italian Imperiali divisor system has a slowly-increasing sequence (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, ...), with 0.5 difference between consecutive divisors. This is tighter than the d'Hondt divisors for which this difference is 1. Like d'Hondt, the Imperiali system is designed to encourage coalitions and secure majority governments under a PR system, but the Imperiali will be the most favourable to large parties as they will gain many seats before their quotients are reduced below those of the smaller parties.

```{r highestAverages7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6, 
                method = "imperiali") 
```

The Belgian municipal councils were elected by the Imperiali highest averages method. The following example comes from the 2006 election in Bruges, where 47 seats were upon.

```{r highestAverages8, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
Bruges=c("CD&V/N-VA"=32092, "SP.A/Spirit"=20028, 
         "Flemish Interest"=13408, "Open VLD/Vivant"=9520,
         "Green!"=5328, "Other"=2207)

highestAverages(parties=names(Bruges),
                votes=Bruges, 
                seats = 47,
                method = "imperiali") 
```

### Hungtinton-Hill

The method proposed by Joseph Hill and Edward Huntington does not use a standard divisor, but a different one and also a modified quota such that rounding with cut-off point at *geometric* mean: hh = $\sqrt{L(L + 1)}$. This method makes sense only if every party is guaranteed at least one seat. It has been used for allotting seats in the US House of Representatives to the states.


```{r highestAverages9, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
highestAverages(parties=names(lijphart),
                votes=lijphart, 
                seats = 6, method = "hh") 
```

### Using Thresholds

Let's assume that we have an election with 1,000 total voters in which five parties (A, B, C, D, and E) have gained 100 (10\%), 150 (15\%), 300 (30\%), 400 (40\%), and 50 (5\%) votes, respectively. In this electoral constituency, there are 3 seats up for election, and all votes cast are valid. The electoral system has a 7\% vote threshold, meaning that parties must get at least 7\% of the total unspoiled votes cast in order to participate in the distribution of seats. Party *E* would then be elimiated from competition at the outset. 

If the d'Hondt method of seat allocation were employed in this hypothetical election, then party *C* would get 1 seat (or 33\% of the number of seats), and party *D* 2 seats (or 67\% of the seats).

```{r highestAverages10, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}

const <- c("A"=100, "B"=150,"C"=300, "D"=400, "E"=50)

highestAverages(parties=names(const),
                votes=const,
                seats = 3, method = "dh",
                threshold = 7/100) 
```


The following example is taken from the 2015 general elections in Spain. The region of Valencia returned 15 seats allocated using the D'Hondt method in a closed list PR system. Only lists that poll at least 3% of the total vote (which includes expoiled votes "en blanco") can be considered.

```{r Valencia-election, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, comment=NA}
(Valencia <- c("PP"=442005, "Podemos"=395729, "PSOE"=275680,
              "C's"=221299, "IU"=68759, "PACMA"=14445, "Others"=35943)) 
blanco=8738
nulo=11891
```

```{r Valencia, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
# Valencia returned 15 members
highestAverages(parties=names(Valencia),
                votes=Valencia, 
                seats=15, method = "dh",
                threshold = 3/100)
```


Next, the methods that divide the votes by a mathematically derived quota, such as the Droop quota, the Hare quota (or Hamilton/Vinton), and the Imperiali quota. 


## Largest Remainder Methods of Allocating Seats Proportionally

Highest averages methods allocate seats proportionally to the number of votes by dividing the number of votes required for each party by a quota. The quota may vary because it is the result of dividing the number of unspoiled votes ($v$) by some whole number close to the number of seats that would next be assigned ($s$). In what follows are llustrative examples of the operation of some largest remainders formulas in an eight member district with the same four parties of the previous examples.

### Hare quota
The Droop quota is obtained by quota = $\frac{v}{(s)}$.

```{r largestRemainders1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
largestRemainders(parties=names(lijphart),
                  votes=lijphart, 
                  seats = 8, method = "hare") 
```

### Droop quota
The Droop quota is obtained by quota = $\frac{v}{(s + 1)}+1$.

```{r largestRemainders2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
largestRemainders(parties=names(lijphart), 
                  votes=lijphart, 
                  seats = 8, method = "droop") 
```


### Hagenbach-Bischoff
The Hagenbach-Bischoff quota is obtained by $\frac{v}{(s + 1)}$.

```{r largestRemainders3, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
largestRemainders(parties=names(lijphart),
                  votes=lijphart, 
                  seats = 8, method = "hagb") 
```


### Imperiali quota
The Imperiali quota is obtained by $\frac{v}{(s + 2)}$. For Italian elections during the 1950s, the quota used was a reinforced version of the quota: $\frac{v}{(s + 3)}$.
 
```{r data-Italy, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# The 1946 Italian Constituent Assembly election results: parties and unspoilt votes

Italy = data.frame(party=c("DC", "PSIUP", "PCI", "UDN", "UQ", "PRI",
                            "BNL", "PdA", "MIS", "PCd'I", "CDR",
                           "PSd'Az", "MUI", "PCS", "PDL", "FDPR"),
                   votes=c(8101004, 4758129, 4356686, 1560638,	1211956,
                           1003007, 637328, 334748, 171201, 102393,
                           97690, 78554, 71021, 51088, 40633, 21853))
```

```{r largestRemainders4, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
with(Italy, largestRemainders(parties=party,
                              votes=votes, seats = 556,
                              method = "imperiali.q") )
```



## Suitable output for recycling within RMarkdown documents 

The output produced by `highestAveragesof()` and `largestRemainders()`  functions is of class `data.frame`. Which R users are already familiar with, and that makes the usage with other aplications very straightforward too. For instance, one may want to produce publishable-quality table of the output with the **knitr** package or graphs with **ggplot2**.

Let's take the data from 2014 Brazilian legislative elections, especifically from one electoral district--the state of Ceará to compare how that caucus would look like among different apportionment methods.

```{r Ceara-election, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Results for the state legislative house of Ceará (2014):
Ceara <- c("PCdoB"=187906, "PDT"=326841,"PEN"=132531, "PMDB"=981096,
           "PRB"=2043217,"PSB"=15061, "PSC"=103679, "PSTU"=109830,
           "PTdoB"=213988, "PTC"=67145, "PTN"=278267)
```

Once the data is loaded, to produce a table with seat assignment results follows effortless, for example with `kable()`, `pandoc.table()`, `xtable()`, etc.

```{r highestAverages11, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
mytable = highestAverages(parties=names(Ceara), 
                          votes=Ceara,
                          seats = 42, method = "dh") 

library(knitr)

kable(mytable, align=c("l","c","c"), caption="Outcome under d'Hondt")
```


Next, we produce a graph comparing three highest-averages formulas we have just computed.

```{r largestRemainders5, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", fig.cap= "2014 Legislative Election in Ceará (M=42)"}

out1 = highestAverages(parties=names(Ceara), votes=Ceara, 
                seats = 42, method = "dh")
out2 = highestAverages(parties=names(Ceara), votes=Ceara, 
                seats = 42, method = "imperiali") 
out3 = highestAverages(parties=names(Ceara), votes=Ceara, 
                seats = 42, method = "sl")

# add the method:
out1$Method = "d'Hondt"
out2$Method = "imperiali"
out3$Method = "Saint-Laguë"


data <- rbind(out1, out2, out3)

p = ggplot(data=data, aes(x=reorder(Party, -Seats), y=Seats, fill=Method)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
   labs(x="", y="Seats")
p + scale_fill_fte() + 
  theme_fte(legend = "top") 
```


```{r largestRemainders6, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, fig.align="center", fig.cap= "2014 Legislative Election in Ceara (M=42)"}

Considers the following `data.frame` with electoral results for the 1999 election in Helsinki, the seats were allocated using both Saint-Laguë and D'Hondt methods so we can compare the effect of the allocation formulas on the effective number of parties.

# Measures of Proportionality
